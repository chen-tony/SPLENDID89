# SPLENDID

**For any updates, please check our [main repository](https://github.com/chen-tony/SPLENDID)

SPLENDID is a biobank-scale penalized regression framework to model shared and heterogeneity genetic effects, such as across diverse ancestries, published at [Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-026-03235-2). The software (detailed below) requires R, C++, and plink2, and entirely run through command line arguments. Much of the package borrows code from the [bigstatsr](https://github.com/privefl/bigstatsr) package for efficient analysis of large genetic data. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome to improve code functionality and usability!

# Tutorial
## Required R packages
```
Rscript -e 'install.packages(c('optparse', 'Rcpp','RcppArmadillo', 'dplyr', 'data.table','tidyr', 'bigsnpr', 'Matrix', 'bigparallelr', 'foreach', 'glmnet'))'
```

## Create file-backed matrix for genotype data
Inputs require the following formats:
- BFILE: plink file without .bed/.bim/.fam extensions
- OUT: header for output file name (keep consistent throughout)
- KEEP.txt: text file with two columns (FID and IID) for all samples to use in analysis
- EXTRACT.txt: text file with SNPs to use in analysis
- NCORES: number of cores for parallel computing
- VERBOSE: 0 (no messaging), 1 (some messaging), 2 (more messsaging)
```
Rscript splendid_bigsnpr \
--bfile BFILE \
--out OUT \
--keep KEEP.txt \
--extract EXTRACT.txt \
--ncores NCORES \
--verbose VERBOSE
```
This will create an FBM for efficient analysis of individual-level data. If there are missing values, we can either ignore NAs (impute with 0), or impute with various options within the bigsnpr package. 

## Run initial summaries of data
Heterogeneity can be measured by meta-analysis of external GWAS or an interaction GWAS within the training data. For interaction GWAS, inputs require the following formats:
- BFILE: plink file without .bed/.bim/.fam extensions
- OUT: header for output file name (keep consistent throughout)
- PLINK2: path to plink2 software
- KEEP.txt: text file with two columns (FID and IID) for training samples
- EXTRACT.txt: text file with SNPs to use in analysis
- COVAR.txt: text file with FID, IID, and covariates
- COVAR_NAMES: comma-separated list of covariates of interest
- INTERACT_NAMES: command-separated list of covariates of interest for interactions
- PHENO.txt: text file with FID, IID, and phenotype(s)
- PHENO_NAME: name of phenotype of interest
- NCORES: number of cores for multi-threading in plink2
- VERBOSE: 0 (no messaging), 1 (some messaging), 2 (more messsaging)
```
Rscript splendid_gwas \
--bfile BFILE \
--out OUT \
--plink2 PLINK2 \
--keep KEEP.txt \
--extract EXTRACT.txt \
--covar COVAR.txt \
--covar-names COVAR_NAMES \
--interact-names INTERACT_NAMES \
--pheno PHENO.txt \
--pheno-name PHENO_NAME \
--ncores NCORES \
--verbose VERBOSE
```
This gives a text file with p-values for heterogeneity used for thresholding in regression. 

Then, we compute summaries within the training data to initialize in regression, with the following inputs:
Inputs require the following formats:
- BIGSNPR: FBM file for genotype data (with .rds extension)
- OUT: header for output file name (keep consistent throughout)

- COVAR.txt: text file with FID, IID, and covariates
- COVAR_NAMES: comma-separated list of covariates of interest
- INTERACT_NAMES: command-separated list of covariates of interest for interactions
- PHENO.txt: text file with FID, IID, and phenotype(s)
- PHENO_NAME: name of phenotype of interest
- NCORES: number of cores for multi-threading in plink2
- VERBOSE: 0 (no messaging), 1 (some messaging), 2 (more messsaging)
- IMPUTED: 0 to replace NA with 0, 1 if the FBM is already imputed (using bigsnpr package)
```

- HET_GWAS: heterogeneity GWAS file with three columns:
  - marker.ID: SNP names
  - P_ADD: p-values for main effects
  - P_HET: p-values for heterogeneity
- WEIGHTS: penalty factors for adaptive L0L1 penalty
  - marker.ID: SNP names
  - weights: penalty factors (default weight=1)
- LAMBDA: comma-separated list of lambda1 values
  - default to 5 log-scale values between 1e-2 and 1e-4

# Notes
- SPLENDID was primarily built for multi-ancestry PRS analysis, where we use interactions with ancestry PCs to model heterogeneity. However, it can be run without interactions for analysis of a single ancestry or with interactions with other factors besides ancestry. 
- SPLENDID is currently built assuming a training - tuning - validation data split structure. However, the same code can be used for cross-validation-type analysis by running it several times on different folds of the training data. Then, one can use the multiple folds to choose specific tuning parameters, or combine models across folds similar to the CMSA strategy in bigstatsr. We include example scripts to do this in our All of Us analysis.
